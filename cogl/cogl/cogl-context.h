/**
 * CoglContext:
 *
 * The top level application context.
 *
 * A #CoglContext is the top most sandbox of Cogl state for an
 * application or toolkit. Its main purpose is to act as a sandbox
 * for the memory management of state objects. Normally an application
 * will only create a single context since there is no way to share
 * resources between contexts.
 *
 * For those familiar with OpenGL or perhaps Cairo it should be
 * understood that unlike these APIs a Cogl context isn't a rendering
 * context as such. In other words Cogl doesn't aim to provide a state
 * machine style model for configuring rendering parameters. Most
 * rendering state in Cogl is directly associated with user managed
 * objects called pipelines and geometry is drawn with a specific
 * pipeline object to a framebuffer object and those 3 things fully
 * define the state for drawing. This is an important part of Cogl's
 * design since it helps you write orthogonal rendering components
 * that can all access the same GPU without having to worry about
 * what state other components have left you with.
 *
 * Cogl does not maintain internal references to the context for
 * resources that depend on the context so applications. This is to
 * help applications control the lifetime a context without us needing to
 * introduce special api to handle the breakup of internal circular
 * references due to internal resources and caches associated with the
 * context.
 *
 * One a context has been destroyed then all directly or indirectly
 * dependent resources will be in an inconsistent state and should not
 * be manipulated or queried in any way.
 *
 * For applications that rely on the operating system to clean up
 * resources this policy shouldn't affect them, but for applications
 * that need to carefully destroy and re-create Cogl contexts multiple
 * times throughout their lifetime (such as Android applications) they
 * should be careful to destroy all context dependent resources, such as
 * framebuffers or textures etc before unrefing and destroying the
 * context.
