/**
 * SECTION:cogl-framebuffer
 * @short_description: A common interface for manipulating framebuffers
 *
 * Framebuffers are a collection of buffers that can be rendered too.
 * A framebuffer may be comprised of one or more color buffers, an
 * optional depth buffer and an optional stencil buffer. Other
 * configuration parameters are associated with framebuffers too such
 * as whether the framebuffer supports multi-sampling (an anti-aliasing
 * technique) or dithering.
 *
 * There are two kinds of framebuffer in Cogl, #CoglOnscreen
 * framebuffers and #CoglOffscreen framebuffers. As the names imply
 * offscreen framebuffers are for rendering something offscreen
 * (perhaps to a texture which is bound as one of the color buffers).
 * The exact semantics of onscreen framebuffers depends on the window
 * system backend that you are using, but typically you can expect
 * rendering to a #CoglOnscreen framebuffer will be immediately
 * visible to the user.
 *
 * If you want to create a new framebuffer then you should start by
 * looking at the #CoglOnscreen and #CoglOffscreen constructor
 * functions, such as cogl_offscreen_new_with_texture() or
 * cogl_onscreen_new(). The #CoglFramebuffer interface deals with
 * all aspects that are common between those two types of framebuffer.
 *
 * Setup of a new CoglFramebuffer happens in two stages. There is a
 * configuration stage where you specify all the options and ancillary
 * buffers you want associated with your framebuffer and then when you
 * are happy with the configuration you can "allocate" the framebuffer
 * using cogl_framebuffer_allocate(). Technically explicitly calling
 * cogl_framebuffer_allocate() is optional for convenience and the
 * framebuffer will automatically be allocated when you first try to
 * draw to it, but if you do the allocation manually then you can
 * also catch any possible errors that may arise from your
 * configuration.

 *
 * <note>Many applications don't support any fallback options at least when
 * they are initially developed and in that case the don't need to use this API
 * since Cogl will automatically allocate a framebuffer when it first gets

 * cogl_framebuffer_draw_indexed_attributes:
 * @framebuffer: A destination #CoglFramebuffer
 * @pipeline: A #CoglPipeline state object
 * @mode: The #CoglVerticesMode defining the topology of vertices
 * @first_vertex: The vertex offset within the given attributes to draw from
 * @n_vertices: The number of vertices to draw from the given attributes
 * @indices: The array of indices used by the GPU to lookup attribute
 *           data for each vertex.
 * @attributes: An array of pointers to #CoglAttribute<-- -->s defining vertex
 *              geometry
 * @n_attributes: The number of attributes in the @attributes array.
 *
 * Behaves the same as cogl_framebuffer_draw_attributes() except that
 * instead of reading vertex data sequentially from the specified
 * @attributes the @indices provide an indirection for how the data
 * should be indexed allowing a random access order to be
 * specified.
 *
 * For example an indices array of [0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 3] could be used
 * used to draw two triangles (@mode = %COGL_VERTICES_MODE_TRIANGLES +
 * @n_vertices = 6) but only provide attribute data for the 4 corners
 * of a rectangle. When the GPU needs to read in each of the 6
 * vertices it will read the @indices array for each vertex in
 * sequence and use the index to look up the vertex attribute data. So
 * here you can see that first and fourth vertex will point to the
 * same data and third and fifth vertex will also point to shared
 * data.
 *
 * Drawing with indices can be a good way of minimizing the size of a
 * mesh by allowing you to avoid data for duplicate vertices because
 * multiple entries in the index array can refer back to a single
 * shared vertex.
 *
 * <note>The @indices array must be at least as long as @first_vertex
 * + @n_vertices otherwise the GPU will overrun the indices array when
 * looking up vertex data.</note>
 *
 * Since it's very common to want to draw a run of rectangles using
 * indices to avoid duplicating vertex data you can use
 * cogl_get_rectangle_indices() to get a set of indices that can be
 * shared.
 *
 * This drawing api doesn't support high-level meta texture types such
 * as #CoglTexture2DSliced so it is the user's responsibility to
 * ensure that only low-level textures that can be directly sampled by
 * a GPU such as #CoglTexture2D, #CoglTextureRectangle or
 * #CoglTexture3D are associated with layers of the given @pipeline.
 *
 * <note>This api doesn't support any of the legacy global state
 * options such as cogl_set_depth_test_enabled(),
 * cogl_set_backface_culling_enabled() or cogl_program_use()</note>
 *
 * Stability: unstable
 * Since: 1.10
 * Deprecated: 1.16: Use #CoglPrimitive<!-- -->s and
 *                   cogl_primitive_draw() instead
