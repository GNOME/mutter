/**
 * SECTION:cogl-multi-plane-texture
 * @title: CoglMultiPlaneTexture
 * @short_description: A non-primitive texture that can have multiple planes.
 *
 * #CoglMultiPlaneTexture allows one to deal with non-trivial formats that
 * have multiple planes, requires subsampling and/or aren't in RGB. A common
 * example of this are decoded video frames, which often use something in the
 * YUV colorspace, combined with subsampling.
 *
 * The basic idea of a #CoglMultiPlaneTexture is the following:
 * - Each plane is represented by a separate #CoglTexture. That means that you
 *   should add each of these planes as a layer to your CoglPipeline.
 * - When dealing with a color space that is not RGB, you can ask the
 *   #CoglMultiPlaneTexture to create a shader for you that does the conversion
 *   in the GPU.
 * - In case you need to deal with memory access in a format with subsampling,
 *   you can use cogl_multi_plane_texture_get_width() and its analogous version
 *   for the height to get the correct size of the texture.
