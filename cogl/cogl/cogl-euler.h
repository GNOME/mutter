/**
 * SECTION:cogl-euler
 * @short_description: Functions for initializing and manipulating
 * euler angles.
 *
 * Euler angles are a simple representation of a 3 dimensional
 * rotation; comprised of 3 ordered heading, pitch and roll rotations.
 * An important thing to understand is that the axis of rotation
 * belong to the object being rotated and so they also rotate as each
 * of the heading, pitch and roll rotations are applied.
 *
 * One way to consider euler angles is to imagine controlling an
 * aeroplane, where you first choose a heading (Such as flying south
 * east), then you set the pitch (such as 30 degrees to take off) and
 * then you might set a roll, by dipping the left, wing as you prepare
 * to turn.
 *
 * They have some advantages and limitations that it helps to be
 * aware of:
 *
 * Advantages:
 * <itemizedlist>
 * <listitem>
 * Easy to understand and use, compared to quaternions and matrices,
 * so may be a good choice for a user interface.
 * </listitem>
 * <listitem>
 * Efficient storage, needing only 3 components any rotation can be
 * represented.
 * <note>Actually the #CoglEuler type isn't optimized for size because
 * we may cache the equivalent #CoglQuaternion along with a euler
 * rotation, but it would be trivial for an application to track the
 * components of euler rotations in a packed float array if optimizing
 * for size was important. The values could be passed to Cogl only when
 * manipulation is necessary.</note>
 * </listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
 *
 * Disadvantages:
 * <itemizedlist>
 * <listitem>
 * Aliasing: it's possible to represent some rotations with multiple
 * different heading, pitch and roll rotations.
 * </listitem>
 * <listitem>
 * They can suffer from a problem called Gimbal Lock. A good
 * explanation of this can be seen on wikipedia here:
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock but basically two
 * of the axis of rotation may become aligned and so you loose a
 * degree of freedom. For example a pitch of +-90° would mean that
 * heading and bank rotate around the same axis.
 * </listitem>
 * <listitem>
 * If you use euler angles to orient something in 3D space and try to
 * transition between orientations by interpolating the component
 * angles you probably wont get the transitions you expect as they may
 * not follow the shortest path between the two orientations.
 * </listitem>
 * <listitem>
 * There's no standard to what order the component axis rotations are
 * applied. The most common convention seems to be what we do in Cogl
 * with heading (y-axis), pitch (x-axis) and then roll (z-axis), but
 * other software might apply x-axis, y-axis then z-axis or any other
 * order so you need to consider this if you are accepting euler
 * rotations from some other software. Other software may also use
 * slightly different aeronautical terms, such as "yaw" instead of
 * "heading" or "bank" instead of "roll".
 * </listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
 *
 * To minimize the aliasing issue we may refer to "Canonical Euler"
 * angles where heading and roll are restricted to +- 180° and pitch is
 * restricted to +- 90°. If pitch is +- 90° bank is set to 0°.
 *
 * Quaternions don't suffer from Gimbal Lock and they can be nicely
 * interpolated between, their disadvantage is that they don't have an
 * intuitive representation.
 *
 * A common practice is to accept angles in the intuitive Euler form
 * and convert them to quaternions internally to avoid Gimbal Lock and
 * handle interpolations. See cogl_quaternion_init_from_euler().
