        NotifyPointerAxis:

        A smooth pointer axis event notification. Relative motion deltas are to
        be interpreted as pixel movement of a standardized mouse.

        Additionally to the smooth pointer axis event notification, an emulated
        discrete pointer axis event notification is emitted based on the
        submitted accumulated smooth scrolling steps.
        The base for these emulated discrete pointer axis event is the discrete
        step with the value 10.0.
        This means that for a delta dx (or dy) with the value 10.0 one emulated
        discrete scrolling event is emitted.
        For a high resolution smooth pointer axis event, a smaller value is
        submitted for each scrolling step.
        This means: For a double resolution mouse wheel one emulated discrete
        event is emitted for 2 smooth pointer axis events with each having the
        value 5.0.

        Possible @flags:
          1: finish - scroll motion was finished (e.g. fingers lifted)
          2: source_wheel - The scroll event is originated by a mouse wheel.
          4: source_finger - The scroll event is originated by one or more
                             fingers on the device (eg. touchpads).
          8: source_continuous - The scroll event is originated by the motion
                                 of some device (eg. a scroll button is set).

          Maximum one of the @flags 'source_wheel', 'source_finger',
          'source_continuous' may be specified.
          If no source flag is specified, `source_finger` is assumed.
