/**
 * ClutterOffscreenEffect:
 *
 * Base class for effects using offscreen buffers
 *
 * #ClutterOffscreenEffect is an abstract class that can be used by
 * [class@Effect] sub-classes requiring access to an offscreen buffer.
 *
 * Some effects, like the fragment shader based effects, can only use GL
 * textures, and in order to apply those effects to any kind of actor they
 * require that all drawing operations are applied to an offscreen framebuffer
 * that gets redirected to a texture.
 *
 * #ClutterOffscreenEffect provides all the heavy-lifting for creating the
 * offscreen framebuffer, the redirection and the final paint of the texture on
 * the desired stage.
 *
 *
 * ## Implementing a ClutterOffscreenEffect
 *
 * Creating a sub-class of #ClutterOffscreenEffect requires, in case
 * of overriding the [class@Effect] virtual functions, to chain up to the
 * #ClutterOffscreenEffect's implementation.
 *
 * On top of the [class@Effect]'s virtual functions,
 * #ClutterOffscreenEffect also provides a [vfunc@OffscreenEffect.paint_target]
 * function, which encapsulates the effective painting of the texture that
 * contains the result of the offscreen redirection.
 *
 * The size of the target pipeline is defined to be as big as the
 * transformed size of the [class@Actor] using the offscreen effect.
 * Sub-classes of #ClutterOffscreenEffect can change the texture creation
 * code to provide bigger textures by overriding the
 * [vfunc@OffscreenEffect.create_texture] virtual function; no chain up
 * to the #ClutterOffscreenEffect implementation is required in this
 * case.
 *
 * ## Paint nodes
 *
 * #ClutterOffscreenEffect generates the following paint node tree:
 *
 * ```
 * Effect
 *  ├─────────┐
 * Layer   Pipeline
 *  │
 * Actor
 * ```
 *
 * When the actor contents are cached, the generated paint node tree
 * looks like this:
 *
 * ```
 * Effect
 *  │
 * Pipeline
 * ```
 *
 * In both cases, the "Pipeline" node is created with the return value
 * of [vfunc@OffscreenEffect.create_pipeline].
