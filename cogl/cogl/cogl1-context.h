 * cogl_set_source_texture:
 * @texture: The #CoglTexture you want as your source
 *
 * This is a convenience function for creating a material with the first
 * layer set to @texture and setting that material as the source with
 * cogl_set_source.
 *
 * Note: There is no interaction between calls to cogl_set_source_color
 * and cogl_set_source_texture. If you need to blend a texture with a color then
 * you can create a simple material like this:
 * <programlisting>
 * material = cogl_material_new ();
 * cogl_material_set_color4ub (material, 0xff, 0x00, 0x00, 0x80);
 * cogl_material_set_layer (material, 0, tex_handle);
 * cogl_set_source (material);
 * </programlisting>
 *
 * Since: 1.0
 * Deprecated: 1.16: Latest drawing apis all take an explicit
 *                   #CoglPipeline argument so this stack of
 *                   #CoglMaterial<!-- -->s shouldn't be used.

/**
 * cogl_flush:
 *
 * This function should only need to be called in exceptional circumstances.
 *
 * As an optimization Cogl drawing functions may batch up primitives
 * internally, so if you are trying to use raw GL outside of Cogl you stand a
 * better chance of being successful if you ask Cogl to flush any batched
 * geometry before making your state changes.
 *
 * It only ensure that the underlying driver is issued all the commands
 * necessary to draw the batched primitives. It provides no guarantees about
 * when the driver will complete the rendering.
 *
 * This provides no guarantees about the GL state upon returning and to avoid
 * confusing Cogl you should aim to restore any changes you make before
 * resuming use of Cogl.
 *
 * If you are making state changes with the intention of affecting Cogl drawing
 * primitives you are 100% on your own since you stand a good chance of
 * conflicting with Cogl internals. For example clutter-gst which currently
 * uses direct GL calls to bind ARBfp programs will very likely break when Cogl
 * starts to use ARBfb programs itself for the material API.
 *
 * Since: 1.0
