 *
 * You should understand that a framebuffer owns the following state:
 * <itemizedlist>
 *  <listitem><simpara>The projection matrix</simpara></listitem>
 *  <listitem><simpara>The modelview matrix stack</simpara></listitem>
 *  <listitem><simpara>The viewport</simpara></listitem>
 *  <listitem><simpara>The clip stack</simpara></listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
 * So these items will automatically be saved and restored when you
 * push and pop between different framebuffers.
 *
 * Also remember a newly allocated framebuffer will have an identity matrix for
 * the projection and modelview matrices which gives you a coordinate space
 * like OpenGL with (-1, -1) corresponding to the top left of the viewport,
 * (1, 1) corresponding to the bottom right and +z coming out towards the
 * viewer.
 *
 * If you want to set up a coordinate space like Clutter does with (0, 0)
 * corresponding to the top left and (framebuffer_width, framebuffer_height)
 * corresponding to the bottom right you can do so like this:
 *
 * |[
 * static void
 * setup_viewport (unsigned int width,
 *                 unsigned int height,
 *                 float fovy,
