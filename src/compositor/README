Intro
=====

In general, the compositor splits the window from the contents of
the window from the shape of the window. In other words, a window
has contents, and the contents of the window have a shape. This is
represented by the actor hierarchy:

 +--------------------------------------+
 | MetaWindowActor                      |
 | +----------------------------------+ |
 | | MetaSurfaceActor                 | |
 | | +------------------------------+ | |
 | | | MetaShapedTexture            | | |
 | | |                              | | |
 | | |                              | | |
 | | |                              | | |

## Client and compositor

MetaWindowActor and its subclasses represent the client window's
type. A X11 client will have a MetaWindowActorX11 representing it,
and a Wayland client will have a MetaWindowActorWayland.

On the compositor side, the surface where the contents of the window
are drawn into are represented by MetaSurfaceActor subclasses. On a
Wayland session, windows are backed by a MetaSurfaceActorWayland
surface, whereas on X11 sessions, by MetaSurfaceActorX11.

XWayland windows are X11 client windows (MetaWindowActorX11) backed
by Wayland surfaces (MetaWindowActorWayland).
