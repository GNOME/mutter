 *
 * Sets a function to be called at regular intervals with the given

 * the function will not be called again.  The @notify function is
 * called when the timeout is destroyed.  The first call to the
 * function will be at the end of the first @interval.
 *
 * This function is similar to g_timeout_add_full() except that it
 * will try to compensate for delays. For example, if @func takes half
 * the interval time to execute then the function will be called again
 * half the interval time after it finished. In contrast
 * g_timeout_add_full() would not fire until a full interval after the
 * function completes so the delay between calls would be 1.0 / @fps *
 * 1.5. This function does not however try to invoke the function
 * multiple times to catch up missing frames if @func takes more than
 * @interval ms to execute.
