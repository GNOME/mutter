 * appropriate function for the current backend.
 *
 * This function should not be used to query core opengl API
 * symbols since eglGetProcAddress for example doesn't allow this and
 * and may return a junk pointer if you do.
 *
 * Return value: a pointer to the requested function or %NULL if the

/**
 * cogl_flush:
 *
 * This function should only need to be called in exceptional circumstances.
 *
 * As an optimization Cogl drawing functions may batch up primitives
 * internally, so if you are trying to use raw GL outside of Cogl you stand a
 * better chance of being successful if you ask Cogl to flush any batched
 * geometry before making your state changes.
 *
 * It only ensure that the underlying driver is issued all the commands
 * necessary to draw the batched primitives. It provides no guarantees about
 * when the driver will complete the rendering.
 *
 * This provides no guarantees about the GL state upon returning and to avoid
 * confusing Cogl you should aim to restore any changes you make before
 * resuming use of Cogl.
 *
 * If you are making state changes with the intention of affecting Cogl drawing
 * primitives you are 100% on your own since you stand a good chance of
 * conflicting with Cogl internals. For example clutter-gst which currently
 * uses direct GL calls to bind ARBfp programs will very likely break when Cogl
 * starts to use ARBfb programs itself for the material API.
