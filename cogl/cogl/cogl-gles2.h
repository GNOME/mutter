 * @short_description: A portable api to access OpenGLES 2.0
 *
 * Cogl provides portable access to the OpenGLES api through a single
 * library that is able to smooth over inconsistencies between the
 * different vendor drivers for OpenGLES in a single place.
 *
 * The api is designed to allow Cogl to transparently implement the
 * api on top of other drivers, such as OpenGL, D3D or on Cogl's own
 * drawing api so even if your platform doesn't come with an
 * OpenGLES 2.0 api Cogl may still be able to expose the api to your
 * application.
 *
 * Since Cogl is a library and not an api specification it is possible
 * to add OpenGLES 2.0 api features to Cogl which can immidiately
 * benefit developers regardless of what platform they are running on.
 *
 * With this api it's possible to re-use existing OpenGLES 2.0 code
 * within applications that are rendering with the Cogl API and also
 * it's possible for applications that render using OpenGLES 2.0 to
 * incorporate content rendered with Cogl.
 *
 * Applications can check for OpenGLES 2.0 api support by checking for
 * %COGL_FEATURE_ID_GLES2_CONTEXT support with cogl_has_feature().
 *
 * Since: 1.12
 * Stability: unstable
